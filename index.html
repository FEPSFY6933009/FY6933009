  The rise in awareness of sustainability (the avoidance of the depletion of natural resources to maintain 
  ecological balance) is becoming increasingly prevalent as the climate continues to worsen, and extreme weather
  events are also becoming higher in intensity and frequency. Extreme weather events are rare occasions of
  weather patterns which deviate from usual weather. For example, tsunamis and wildfires. Despite being the most
  widely used building material, concrete is an unnoticeable contributor to climate change. The carbon emissions 
  from concrete help to raise the global temperature as well as ruin animal ecosystems through the extraction of
  sand from rivers and coasts. However, there's a chance that the future may lead to a rise in sustainable alternatives,
  moving society one step closer to net-zero. This is where the amount of harmful gases emitted into the atmosphere is
  equal to the amount removed from it.

 Many people are interested in the physical appearance of buildings- the floor-to-ceiling windows, the great structures 
 that manage to curve- but how many consider what makes up these buildings, or how they even function? It's rare that
 people think about the materials used for these structures, so they typically aren't aware of the environmental consequences
 that are caused by them, specifically the consequences of concrete. Given how widespread it is, it should be known that
 concrete- even when recycled- negatively affects our environment. Concrete is only second to water in global consumption,
 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350630714000387">(Gagg, C.R.(2014))</a> which means that
 although it's used for its accessibility, that high usage is actively destroying the atmosphere and the impact should be
 looked at further.

 Concrete had its first major 'boom' in usage during post-World War Two development. To this day, major cities, scuh as 
 Birmingham are defined by large concrete structures. Concrete is the source of about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide 
 emissions <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete">(Lehne,
 J. and Preston, F. (2018))</a> The reason why carbon dioxide emission is bad is because when it's released into the 
 atmosphere, it gets trapped inside of the ozone layer, acting as a blanket which doesn't let heat escape, causing the raise in 
 global temperature (also known as global warming). Within the last 70+ years, rural-to-urban migration has significantly 
 increased in major cities such as London. Rural-to-urban migration is defined as the movement of people from countryside areas, to
 cities. This is evident as from 1991 to 2022, the population increased from 6.8 million to 8.9 million and is projected to reach 
 9.3 million in 2025 <a href="https://trustforlondon.org.uk/data/population-over-time/">(Trust For London(2024))</a> This increase
 has led to higher demand for housing, which has been met as housing programmes have resulted in 38,308 new houses between 1 April
 2024 and 31 March 2025, representing an increase by 5% compared to the same period the previous year <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-homes-england-2024-to-2025-housebuilding-statistics-published"
                                                                                                       >(England, H. (2025))</a>
 Therefore, the higher demand for housing to accomodate the higher population has resulted in the need for more building
 materials, causing concrete use to surge further.
  
    <h3><b>Consequences on resources and ecosystems</b></b></h3>

    Concrete has a life span of around 50-100 years <a href="https://fmpconstruction.com/how-long-concrete-last/">(FMP Construction 
    Marketing(2025))</a>
    This means that it must be replaced often, leading to further carbon emissions through repeating the process of making
    the concrete and extracting more sand. One reason for the short life span is weathering processes. Weathering is when a material 
    is worn down due to exposure to the atmosphere. Chemical weathering wears down concrete as acid rain breaks it down and reduces 
    its life span. Furthermore, freeze-thaw weathering can also reduce the life span. This is because water seeps into any cracks in
    the concrete, then the water freezes, causing it to expand, along with the crack. Overtime the size of the crack increases and
    damages the structure, meaning it must be repaired. <a href="https://doi.org/10.14359/51745471">(Mizer, J.K. (2025)</a>
    As well as this, the extraction of sand destroys animal ecosystems
